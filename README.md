# Checkers

2 Player style Checkers:
  - Move diagonally
  - Capture by jumping over pieces diagonally (can jump/capture multiple times).
  - If one side's pieces have all been captured, the other side wins.
  - If no available moves left for both sides, the side that made the last legal move wins the game.

Basically the same rules as regular Checkers except for:
  - Forced to capture all pieces available for a piece (normally forced to capture one piece)
  - After promotion, king can bounce off and capture more pieces if available

Does not include conditions for a draw (40 moves without a capture, 3 move repetition)

Actions:
  - Press "N" for new game
  - Exit by closing window
  - Click ono piece to move to a valid square
